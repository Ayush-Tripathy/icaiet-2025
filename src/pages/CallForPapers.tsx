        This International Conference On Artificial Intelligence And Emerging
        Technologies (ICAIET-2025), is dedicated to advanced research in the
        areas of microwave as well as antenna engineering, signal processing and
        communication. The conference aims at bringing together the researchers,
        scientists, engineers and research scholars from all areas of
        engineering and technology, to provide an international forum to
        exchange their ideas, foster collaboration, practical developments
        experiences and cover new grounds. The conference will feature invited
        talks by eminent researchers from around the world, technical paper
        sessions, poster sessions, demos, tutorials and workshops. Accepted
        papers will be submitted for inclusion into IEEE Xplore subject to
        meeting IEEE Xploreâ€™s scope and quality requirements. Prospective
        authors are encouraged to submit their original research contributions
        in IEEE format. Papers submitted to ICAIET 2025 should contain original
        research/study and should not have been published or submitted for
        publication elsewhere. The IEEE anti-plagiarism policy is applicable to
        all submissions. At least one author of each accepted paper must
